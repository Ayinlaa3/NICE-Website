              The Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) is the umbrella organization for the Engineering profession in Nigeria and was established on 6th February, 1958 in London and later inaugurated in Lagos on 20th August, 1960. In an effort to further enhance professionalism and interaction among its members, the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) encouraged the formation of Divisions of NSE along the lines of professional discipline. One of such divisions is the Nigerian Institution of Civil Engineers (NICE) established 2001. In 1984, therefore, the Council of NSE approved the establishment of the Civil Engineering Division. The mantle of nurturing and coordinating the activities of the Division fell on Rev. Canon Engr. M. O. Akintobi FNSE, who worked very hard to scale through the initial hurdle of generating the interest of members in the Division.

            At the December 2001 NSE AGM in Port Harcourt, during which the Division won for the first time, the Best Division Trophy of the NSE Group Dynamics session, the Civil Division was granted the status of an Institution by the NSE as recognized and subscribed to in its Articles and Memorandum of Association by the foursome of Engr. H.O.B. Lawal (Chairman), Engr. Dr. T. M. Olatunji (General Secretary), Engr. Chika Chukwuani (Publicity Secretary) and Engr. Dr. J. O. Akanmu (Financial Secretary/De facto Technical Secretary) acting on behalf of all Civil Engineers in Nigeria. Consequently, Engr. Segun Adedeji was elected the pioneer chairman of the Institution, 2002/2003. In 2014 and 2015 at the AGM in Abuja and Akure respectively, NICE emerged for the second and third times as the Best Division of NSE Group Dynamics Competition in its nineteen years of existence as an Institution.
